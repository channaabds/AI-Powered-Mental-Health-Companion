## 🧠 Overview

FeelSafe is an AI-powered mental health companion designed to simulate empathetic interaction through a video call interface. The system leverages multimodal emotional analysis by combining:

- 🖼️ Real-time facial expression recognition  
- 🎙️ Voice tone analysis  

to detect the user's emotional state, and respond using a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built on top of a Large Language Model (LLM). All responses are grounded in validated psychological references, making the interaction more human, contextual, and supportive.
